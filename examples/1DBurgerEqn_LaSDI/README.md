Procedure:
- The data can be generated by running `generate_data.ipynb` in the "1DBurgerEqn" folder; Note: create a folder (named as "data") to store the data
- run `train_model_sec4-1_case2.ipynb` to train a gLaSDI model by submitting a job using `batch_job.bsub`; Note: create a folder (named as "fig") to store model parameters and figures (next step)
- run `test_model.ipynb` to evalute the trained model
